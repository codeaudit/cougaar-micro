# This file defines some extended bytecode assignment used to access
# raw JEM memory. Values are in decimal unless given with a leading 0
# digit, in which case the value is hex.

#
# These names are arbitrary; we supply both the name and the opcode value.
# These names can be referenced in the native replacements file.
