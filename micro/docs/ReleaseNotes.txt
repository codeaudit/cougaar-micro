Cougaar MicroEdition Release notes for V1.1
Notes:
* Cougaar SE 9 requires JDK1.4 to compile and run.  The current (1.0.3) SUN 
  CLDC doesn't work with JDK 1.4, it works with JDK 1.3.  You'll have to be 
  careful with your path.
Changes:
* Update for CougaarSE 9.x
* Add data/Makefile.se for building cougaarmedomain.jar
