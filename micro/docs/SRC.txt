This is a README file for the src directory under micro...

Welcome to the top of the Cougaar MicroEdition source tree. Like
the Standard Edition. All of our code lives under org.cougaar.
From there you will find a microedition directory, under which 
exists the individual directories for .java files. For example:

org/cougaar/microedition/node/Node.java, where the top main method
which you would invoke to kick off a Micro Cougaar lives.

org.cougaar.microedition.io.*; which you would import to include
final processing target independent interfaces for socket io, 
among other things.

org.cougaar.microedition.plugin; which is the namespace of the 
package which provides the abstract classes to support plugins,
among other things.

Other directories under src besides org are com and tutorial. Tutorial
contains some hacked versions of the tutorial code from the Alp Plugin
Developers course. The com directory contains code specific to support 
the Dallas Semiconductor iButtons. These files are not needed for a KVM
distribution as they are specific to a TINI board and its ancillary H/W.
Speaking of code specific to a particular final processing target (TINI
or J2ME-CLDC/KVM) you will find under the microedition subdirectory a TINI
directory and a KVM directory which is where ".java" files specific to 
each target lives.

Since java has no compile time conditionals, run time conditionals and the
System.getProperty("...") method were used to determine at runtime which
target we are running on in order to use appropriate classes accordingly...
