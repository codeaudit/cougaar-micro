This is a README file for the microedition directory under src/org/cougaar...

Welcome to the org/cougaar/microedition directory from here you will
find the meat of the MicroEdition source code. This directory contains
a number of subdirectories, descriptions of same follows:

asset	a directory where code concerning microassets and microclusters lives.
cluster	where the top level Node.java file and the "main" for MicroCluster lives.
demo	code used at the December 2000 ALP Workshop to show ME capabilities.
domain	place where SE (Big Cougaar) code specific to support ME's lives. We
	call this domain cougaarMEdomain.
io	Socket interfaces, listener, reader and transport code lives here.
kvm	kvm (j2me-cldc) specific code lives here.
ldm	Subscriptoin, subscriber and distributor code lives here.
plugin	Generic plugin classes and interfaces.
shared	a directory specifically for files shared between the ME and SE.
	includes some xml and character handling code.
tini	tini specific code lives here.
util	grab bag of utility routines, MicroEdition.java determines target type.

NOTE:
If you are coding for a specific target, please put such code in the appropriate
tini or kvm (or start another) directory. KVM and TINI each have specific shortcomings
and ommisions. If you change code in any of the non target specific directories, 
please be considerate of the fact that this code will need to be compiled under either
or both of the targets...
